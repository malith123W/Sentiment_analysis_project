# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROJECT

## 📌 Introduction
This project is dedicated to performing sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It leverages Python and Jupyter Notebooks to preprocess textual data, build sentiment classification models, and visualize the results. The primary goal of this repository is to provide an end-to-end workflow for analyzing and predicting the sentiment of user-generated content, such as product reviews or social media posts.

## 🗂️ Project Workflow

- Data Preprocessing :Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis..

- Feature Extraction :Convert text to numerical features (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words).

- Model Training : use algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.

- Evaluation :Measure performance:  Accuracy , Precision , Recall , F1-score

- Visualization : Plot results for better understanding and insights
  
## 🎯 Customizing for Your Data
You can easily adapt this project for your own datasets:

- Replace the sample datasets in the notebooks with your own CSV or text files.
- Run the workflow to analyze your custom data sources.
